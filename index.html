   HTML WRITE UP: 2. The only obvious difference I can see from the 3 different browsers I checked (Chrome, Safari, and Firefox) is visible at the bottom of the webpage where I placed my video and audio clip. Each browser has a slightly different control panel for these file types. Chrome has a light background, safari had no bar at all for the video clip, and a dark, rounded one for the audio, while chrome had a dark background and boxier look to it. The rest of the page seemed pretty standard.

3. My code did not call the field into focus when the term was clicked. This is important for a good user-experience as the words are easier to see then the little circles, so some people may have trouble seeing how to choose an option if not allowed to just click the word.

6. No new issues found
